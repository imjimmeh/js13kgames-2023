# JS13kGames - 2023 Submission

## Overview

This is my repo for my entry to [js13kgames 2023](js13kgames.com).

## Ideation

I have not currently settled on a game idea, but you can find current ideas in the [ideation](./docs/ideation/) folder.

## Architecture

Currently planning to use an ECS system for the code, however I'm unsure if this will cause larger file sizes. Will see!
