# City of Dust

## Game Concept

Create a survival and strategy game where players take on the role of a defender within Baghdad during the Siege of 1258, facing the onslaught of the Mongol army.

## Gameplay

- Resources: Manage limited resources such as food, water, and building materials to sustain the city's defense.
- Population Management: Balance the needs of the population with the demands of defense, deciding who fights and who tends to essential tasks.
- Diplomacy: Negotiate with emissaries from the Mongol army for possible surrender or ceasefire options.
- Random Events: Encounter challenges like disease outbreaks, supply shortages, and enemy breaches.
- Day-Night Cycle: Manage both day and night phases, with different enemy behaviors during each.
- Moral Choices: Make decisions that affect morale, loyalty, and the city's overall resilience.
