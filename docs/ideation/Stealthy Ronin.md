# Stealthy Ronin

## Game Concept

Develop a stealth-based action game where players control a ronin (masterless samurai) tasked with infiltrating Mongol ships at night and eliminating enemies.

## Gameplay

- Controls: Use arrow keys for movement and spacebar for attack.
- Stealth: Navigate the ship while avoiding enemy sightlines to remain undetected.
- Timing: Plan your movements carefully to avoid patrols and reach enemies silently.
- Silent Elimination: Sneak up on Mongol soldiers and eliminate them with precise sword strikes.
- Limited Resources: Balance your health and stealth meters while using limited shurikens or distractions.
- Alert System: Trigger alarms if detected, leading to reinforcements and added difficulty.
- Level Progression: Each level involves infiltrating different ship sections, with increasing challenges.

## Visual Style

Adopt a minimalist pixel-art style to fit the 13kb limit while conveying the stealthy atmosphere.

## Audio

Use simple sound effects for footsteps, sword strikes, and enemy alertness, enhancing the game's tension.

## Winning Condition

Players win by successfully eliminating all assigned enemies on each ship section and completing objectives.

## Losing Condition

Players "lose" if they are detected by enemies, triggering alarms or being overwhelmed by reinforcements.

## Level Design

Design levels with gradually increasing complexity, introducing new obstacles and enemy patterns.

## Leaderboard

Include a simple local leaderboard to encourage players to replay levels for better stealth scores.
